            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>These terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern the access to and use of the Controlio website and control panel (“Platform”), the Controlio client Software (“Software”) and Controlio services (“Services”) of EfficientLab, LLC. (the “Company” or “we/us”), made available to users (“you” or “user/s”) via the Software and at<a href="http://www.controlio.net">http://www.controlio.net</a>.</p>
            <h2>1. Controlio Services and Platform</h2>
            <p>Controlio: Controlio provides services for monitoring and controlling use of computer devices owned by you for controlling use of these devices by your Users when and to the extent such activity is permitted by applicable law and without infringing any third party rights (including User’s fundamental rights) or other applicable regulation. Controlio includes optional services for secure browsing and searching. This includes a service for monitoring and storing online activity reports and content of communications, in particular social networks, and for blocking certain categories of sites, at your option. Controlio provides a dashboard on the Platform for enabling you to configure the level and degree of monitoring of the computer/s and or other devices associated to the account. You are SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for how such dashboard controls are configured and the processing of personal data as a consequence, including its collection, storage and analysis on the Platform. Controlio only implements automatically the configuration and instructions provided by you. Controlio is a work in progress, and we reserve the right to modify or suspend temporarily the Controlio services at any time for any reason. Notice of any suspension will be given in accordance with these terms.</p>
            <p>Platform. The Controlio Platform provides access to the Controlio online control panel, and feedback forms. Through the Controlio Software and Platform, we enable registered users to access and use of our Controlio Services, subject to these Terms.</p>
            <p>Ownership. We own or are licensee of all intellectual and industrial property rights in Controlio. Access to and use of our web-based services and content does not imply any transfer of all or part of these rights to you.</p>
            <p>Trademarks. You will not use our trade marks, trade names, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features or any copyrighted material or which are associated with Controlio without our consent.</p>
            <p>Privacy policy. Controlio enables you to process personal data of Users under your control. Our privacy policy is part of these Terms and is set out at:<a href="http://www.controlio.net/privacy.html">http://www.controlio.net/privacy.html</a>.</p>
            <p>Service Provision. We use reasonable endeavours to make available to you at all times the Platform and Services but we shall not, in any event, be liable for interruptions of Service or down-time. Due to special maintenance, security or capacity issues, and also to some events over which we may not influence (e.g., anomalies in public communication networks, electricity cut offs, etc.), Services may be temporally suspended or affected by brief anomalies.</p>
            <p>Security. You understand that the Controlio Software and Service can be used for transmission of content to the Platform, collected from the Devices associated to your account, and that during processing, your User Content, including contact names, email or IM communications, social network activity and other account information are transferred (encrypted) over the internet. Currently they are not stored in an encrypted manner, as this would prevent the monitoring and filtering services.</p>
            <p>Support. We try to provide the Controlio Service 24/7, however due to maintenance, security or capacity issues, and also to some events over which we may not influence (force majeure), the Platform and Services may be temporally suspended or affected. Our support policy is set out at www.controlio.net.</p>

We do however reserve the right to eliminate at any time any User Content of which we are aware that infringes the law or third party rights.</p>
            <p>Data on termination.  In the event of termination for any reason, your access to your account and all of its contents will be disabled and your User Content will be removed, with the exception of backups (saved only for backup or for any unforeseen circumstances). However, we may retain such User Content to cover any legal responsibilities that may arise from our relationship with you. Access to such data will be blocked in accordance with applicable laws unless such event arises.</p>
            <p>Data retention. If there are any data you wish to retain for legal purposes, you must obtain it via the Control Panel of the Platform prior to termination.

            <h2>6. Fees</h2>
            <p>Fees. The fees for the any payment plans are set out at www.controlio.net. For any payment plans , you agree to pay the fees set out in the Plan selected by you.

Fees for Users or Devices added during the subscription term are charged at the same price as for the pre-existing subscriptions.</p>
            <p>Price updates. Prices for the Services may change at any time by giving you thirty (30) days or more prior written notice. New prices will apply to the next renewal period. If you do not reject such price change in writing requesting termination of Services or in the event of any continued use of the Services after such renewal date, you are deemed to have accepted the new prices.</p>

            <p>Payment. Unless stated otherwise on your Subsctiptions form, all amounts invoiced shall be due and payable in advance on contracting the service and 7 days prior to renewal. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate this Agreement and access to the Services if you do not pay in timely manner. In the event of credit card payment, you will provide us with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to us. If you provide credit card information, you authorise us to charge such credit card for all Services set out in the Subscriptions form for the initial subscription term and subsequently any renewal subscription term(s) as set out herein.</p>
            <p>Late Payments. Overdue charges will accrue late payment interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In the event of late payment, we may condition future subscription renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified herein or we may suspend or terminate this Agreement and access to the Controlio Services.</p>
            <p>Taxes: Unless otherwise provided, prices do not include any taxes that may apply, including without limitation VAT or equivalent sales tax, such taxes being your responsibility.
